# SDK Assets (Export Target)

This folder is an **export target** for the canonical MiniApp bridge script:

- Source: `https://github.com/r3e-network/miniapps` (`_shared/miniapp-bridge.js`)
- Exported to: `platform/host-app/public/sdk/miniapp-bridge.js`

To refresh the copy, use the miniapps repo pipeline (the platform no longer builds local MiniApps).
