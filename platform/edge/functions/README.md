# Supabase Edge Functions

This folder contains **Supabase Edge functions** (Deno) for the MiniApp platform.

Goals:

- keep the gateway **thin** (auth, limits, routing)
- enforce platform rules:
  - **payments = GAS only**
  - **governance = NEO only**
- forward sensitive operations to **TEE services** over **mTLS** in production

Required env vars:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (preferred) or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (fallback)
- `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` (required for `secrets-*`)

Usage tracking:

- `MINIAPP_USAGE_MODE`: `record` (default) or `check` to enforce caps without recording usage.
- `MINIAPP_USAGE_MODE_PAYMENTS`, `MINIAPP_USAGE_MODE_GOVERNANCE`: optional per-intent overrides.
- `CONTRACT_GAS_HASH`: optional override for the native GAS contract hash.

TEE routing env vars (required by functions that proxy to internal services):

- `NEOFEEDS_URL`
- `NEOCOMPUTE_URL`
- `NEOVRF_URL`
- `NEOORACLE_URL`
- `NEOFLOW_URL`
- `TXPROXY_URL`

Notes:

- These functions are intended to be deployed under `supabase/functions/*`
  (or symlinked/copied from here).
- MiniApp manifests must include `contract_hash` unless `news_integration=false`
  and no stats are requested; the indexer relies on it for event ingestion.
- This repo includes a helper to export a Supabase-compatible layout:
  `./scripts/export_supabase_functions.sh` (populates `supabase/functions/`).
- In strict identity / production mode, the TEE services will only trust
  identity headers (`X-User-ID`, `X-Service-ID`) when protected by verified mTLS.
- Authentication: most endpoints accept either `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` or
  `X-API-Key: <key>`. Host-only endpoints (compute/automation/oracle/secrets)
  require API keys with **explicit scopes** in production; bearer JWTs are
  rejected there. API key management endpoints (`api-keys-*`) require a JWT.

Wallet onboarding:

- `wallet-nonce` + `wallet-bind` implement an OAuth-first flow where users must
  bind a Neo N3 address (once signature) before accessing on-chain actions.

Secrets:

- `secrets-list`, `secrets-get`, `secrets-upsert`, `secrets-delete`: manage user secrets stored in Supabase (encrypted via `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`).
- `secrets-permissions`: configure which internal service IDs may read a secret (`secret_policies` table).

API keys:

- `api-keys-create`, `api-keys-list`, `api-keys-revoke`: create/list/revoke user API keys (hashed in DB; raw key returned once).

API key scopes:

- Scopes are optional and stored as a list of strings on the key.
- If a key has an empty scope list, it is treated as full access (backward compatible),
  except for host-only endpoints where explicit scopes are required.
- Recommended convention: use the Edge function name as the scope string (e.g. `pay-gas`, `secrets-get`, `oracle-query`).
- A special `*` scope (if present) also grants full access.

Gas bank (delegated payments):

- `gasbank-account`, `gasbank-deposit`, `gasbank-deposits`, `gasbank-transactions`

On-chain invocations (wallet-signed):

- `pay-gas`: returns a GAS `transfer` invocation to `PaymentHub` (**GAS only**).
- `vote-neo`: returns a `Governance.vote` invocation (**NEO only**).
- `app-register`: validates a `manifest` payload, computes `manifest_hash`, and returns an `AppRegistry.registerApp` invocation (developer wallet-signed).
- `app-update-manifest`: validates a `manifest` payload, computes `manifest_hash`, and returns an `AppRegistry.updateApp` invocation (developer wallet-signed).

Catalog + stats:

- `miniapp-stats`: aggregate stats (public read).
- `miniapp-notifications`: notifications feed (public read).
- `market-trending`: trending MiniApps (public read).
- `miniapp-usage`: per-user daily usage (auth required).

TEE-routed:

- `rng-request`: executes RNG via `neovrf` and can optionally anchor to `RandomnessLog` through `txproxy`.
- `datafeed-price`: read proxy to `neofeeds` (future: cache/SSE/WebSocket).
- `oracle-query`: allowlisted HTTP fetch via `neooracle` (optional secret injection).
- `compute-execute`, `compute-jobs`, `compute-job`: host-gated proxy for `neocompute` script execution and job inspection.
- `automation-*`: **DEPRECATED** - Automation has been migrated to PostgreSQL-based system in host-app (`/api/automation/*`).
