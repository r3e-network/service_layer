# Frontend (Legacy)

This directory currently contains only a prebuilt static bundle under `frontend/dist/`
and local `node_modules/` artifacts.

The actively maintained MiniApp host scaffold for this repo lives under:

- `platform/host-app/` (Next.js)

If you intend to bring back a standalone frontend here, add the source (e.g. `src/`)
and a `package.json` + build scripts, then update any deployment docs accordingly.
