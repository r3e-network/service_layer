# Documentation Index

This repository treats the [Neo Service Layer Specification](requirements.md)
as the single source of truth for the platform. All previous supporting docs
have been consolidated into that specification.

## Primary Reference
- [Neo Service Layer Specification](requirements.md)
- [Service Layer Review Checklist](review-checklist.md)
- [CLI Quick Reference](../README.md#cli-quick-reference)
- Tutorials:
  - [Data Feeds Quickstart](examples/datafeeds.md)
  - [DataLink Quickstart](examples/datalink.md)
  - [JAM Quickstart](examples/jam.md)
- Dashboard:
  - [Dashboard Smoke Checklist](dashboard-smoke.md)
- Auditing:
  - `/admin/audit?limit=...&offset=...` (admin JWT) with filters for user/role/tenant/method/path/status. CLI helper: `slctl audit ...`.
- Security:
  - [Security & Production Hardening](security-hardening.md)
- JAM integration notes:
  - [Polkadot JAM-inspired integration](polkadot-jam-integration-design.md)
  - [JAM accumulator & receipt plan](jam-accumulator-plan.md)
  - [JAM receipts and roots](jam-receipts-and-roots.md)
  - [JAM status fields](jam-status-fields.md)
  - [JAM hardening and auth/quotas](jam-hardening.md), [jam-auth-and-quotas.md](jam-auth-and-quotas.md), [jam-hardening-implementation.md](jam-hardening-implementation.md)
- Neo N3 contracts:
  - [Contract set and manager layout](neo-n3-contract-set.md)

All other documents have been retired to avoid drift. Update the specification
directly when behaviour changes so the documentation remains clean, clear, and
consistent.

## Working With The Specification
- Start every change by updating [`requirements.md`](requirements.md); it is the review contract.
- Capture problem statements, API surfaces, storage changes, and operational needs before writing code.
- Link related implementation files so future contributors can navigate from the spec into the codebase.
- Keep examples and sample payloads realistic—tests and SDK snippets should mirror the documented flows.

## Retired Artifacts
- The historical LaTeX/PDF export under `spec/` has been deleted. Markdown is the
  only maintained format going forward.
- Any new documentation should live in this directory unless explicitly called out
  elsewhere (e.g., generated SDK docs). This ensures a single source of truth and
  avoids drift between different formats.
