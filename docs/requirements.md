# Neo N3 Service Layer Specification

## Purpose & Scope
- Deliver a multi-tenant orchestration runtime for Neo N3 that exposes automation, oracle, price feed, randomness, gas bank, wallet, and confidential-compute utilities behind a consistent HTTP API, CLI, and SDK.
- Preserve compatibility with existing Neo services while introducing Chainlink parity (CRE, CCIP, Data Feeds, Data Streams, DataLink, DTA, VRF, Confidential Compute) in the same Go backend.
- Provide a lightweight developer experience that targets self-hosted Supabase Postgres for persistence (no in-memory mode), without requiring Redis or external schedulers. Blockchain node management, billing, and external TEE hosts remain out of scope for this repository.

## Documentation Governance
- This specification is the single source of truth for product behaviour, APIs, storage, and operations. Update it before changing code, Helm charts, or SDKs.
- Use [`docs/README.md`](README.md) as the entry point for related references (Devpack examples, dashboard notes, infrastructure docs).
- Every feature/change proposal must link to the relevant sections below when discussed in issues/PRs so reviewers can trace intent to implementation.
- Deprecations and removals should be staged through this document first, with migration notes captured alongside the affected services.
- Service descriptors expose a single `platform` layer so every capability carries the same priority; update descriptors + docs alongside CLI/dashboard expectations.
- During reviews, step through the [Service Layer Review Checklist](review-checklist.md) to keep documentation, CLI, and dashboard coverage aligned.
- Code layout: the service engine lives under `system/core` (`system/runtime` for wiring), while domain services live under `packages/com.r3e.services.*` (shared helpers in `system/framework/core`). Legacy `internal/app/services` and `internal/core/engine` paths have been removed.

## System Overview
- `cmd/appserver` is the single Go binary that wires all services (`packages/com.r3e.services.*`), HTTP handlers (`applications/httpapi`), and storage adapters (`pkg/storage`).
- Transports (HTTP today, future gRPC/WebSocket) consume services solely through the `applications/services.go` `ServiceProvider` interface so handlers never depend on application wiring structs; both `Application` and `EngineApplication` implement this contract.
- `cmd/slctl` is the CLI wrapper over the HTTP API. It honours `SERVICE_LAYER_ADDR` and `SERVICE_LAYER_TOKEN` for pointing at different environments.
- `apps/dashboard` hosts the React + Vite front-end surface that consumes the same HTTP API for operator workflows. Additional surfaces must be documented here before landing in the repo.
- Dashboard must expose an Engine Bus console to publish events/data/compute fan-out via `/system/events|data|compute`, matching `slctl bus` and the bus quickstart in `docs/examples/bus.md`. Payload presets should reflect the expected shapes for pricefeeds, datafeeds, oracle, datalink, datastreams, and functions. These endpoints are admin-only; the console must require an admin JWT/token. Bus payloads are capped by `BUS_MAX_BYTES` (default 1 MiB).
- `sdk/devpack` plus `examples/functions/devpack` provide the TypeScript toolchain used to author functions locally. Devpack helpers let functions queue automation, oracle, price feed, data feed, data stream, DataLink, gas bank, randomness, and trigger actions that execute after the JavaScript runtime completes. Companion SDKs in Go, Rust, and Python mirror the same action surface for polyglot authoring.
- Persistence requires Supabase Postgres. A valid DSN (`-dsn`, `DATABASE_URL`, or config files under `configs/`) is mandatory; migrations in `system/platform/migrations` must run on startup.
- When Supabase JWT auth is configured (`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`), the self-hosted GoTrue base URL (`SUPABASE_GOTRUE_URL`) must be set; otherwise startup fails (/auth/refresh depends on it).
- `DATABASE_URL` is the canonical DSN override across flags/env/config; file-based DSNs must be superseded by this env to keep compose/.env workflows consistent. Missing/empty DSNs are fatal.
- Optional TEE execution paths use the Goja JavaScript runtime today and can be swapped with Azure Confidential Computing-backed executors when runners are provisioned (see Confidential Compute sections for expectations).
- Engine-managed infrastructure modules (configurable under `runtime.*`):
  - `neo`: enable Neo full node/indexer modules (neo-go RPC + indexer health).
  - `chains`: multi-chain RPC hub (btc/eth/neox/etc.) via configured endpoints.
  - `data_sources`: shared data source hub for feeds/oracles/triggers.
  - `contracts`: contract deploy/invoke manager (network selector).
  - `crypto`: crypto engine exposing ZKP/FHE/MPC helpers (capability list required).
  - `service_bank`: service-owned GAS controller that gates usage across services.
  - `rocketmq`: RocketMQ-backed event bus (producer/consumer). Configure name servers, topic prefix, consumer group, optional namespace/credentials, max reconsume attempts, and optional consume batch size.
- `/system/rpc` proxies JSON-RPC requests to the configured chain RPC hub (first registered RPCEngine); payload shape: `{"chain":"eth","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[...]}`. Requires the chain endpoint to be configured under `runtime.chains.endpoints`. Tenancy and rate limits can be enforced via `runtime.chains.require_tenant`, `per_tenant_per_minute`, `per_token_per_minute`, `burst`, and method allowlists via `allowed_methods`.
  - Validation: enabling `chains` requires at least one endpoint; `data_sources` requires at least one source; `service_bank` requires gasbank/neo to be configured; `crypto` requires a non-empty capabilities list; chain limit/allowlist fields must be non-negative and non-empty.
- Service manifests can declare `requires_apis`; `/system/status` exposes `modules_requires_apis` and `modules_requires_missing`. When `runtime.require_apis_strict=true`, startup fails if any required API surface is missing.

## Functional Requirements
### Service Catalogue
#### Accounts & Authentication
- Manage account/workspace records, metadata, and lifecycle through `/accounts` endpoints and enforce per-account ownership across dependent services.
- Enforce HTTP authentication via static bearer tokens configured through `API_TOKENS` or the `-api-tokens` flag. All endpoints except `/healthz` and `/system/version` require a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- Accept Supabase GoTrue JWTs when `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (and optional `SUPABASE_JWT_AUD`) are configured; `/auth/login` continues to issue JWTs for configured local users and reuses the Supabase JWT secret when no `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` is provided.
- Map Supabase roles listed in `SUPABASE_ADMIN_ROLES` to Service Layer admin for `/admin/*` endpoints.
- Optionally derive tenant from Supabase JWTs using `SUPABASE_TENANT_CLAIM` (dot path, e.g., `app_metadata.tenant`) when `X-Tenant-ID` is absent.
- Optionally derive role from Supabase JWTs using `SUPABASE_ROLE_CLAIM` (dot path, e.g., `app_metadata.role`) before admin-role mapping.
- Provide workspace-level capability descriptors via `/system/descriptors` for dashboards/CLI discovery.

#### Workspace Wallets
- Register signer wallets, threshold policies, and association to accounts. Wallet metadata is exposed under `/accounts/{id}/workspace-wallets` and used by downstream services (CCIP, VRF, Data Feeds, DTA) to gate actions.

#### Secrets Vault
- Store, rotate, and resolve AES-GCM encrypted secrets per account. Plaintext material must never be persisted; secret resolution only happens during function execution.
- Require `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (raw/base64/hex) whenever PostgreSQL is enabled. Reject operations if encryption is misconfigured.

#### Functions Runtime
- Provide CRUD, execution, and execution-history endpoints for JavaScript functions compiled via Goja.
- Allow immediate invocation (`/functions/{id}/execute`) and integrate with automation, oracle, price feed, data feeds, data streams, DataLink, gas bank, trigger, and randomness services through Devpack action queues.
- Record execution metadata (inputs, outputs, action results, errors). Store deterministic randomness signatures when `RANDOM_SIGNING_KEY` is configured.
- Support pluggable executors, including the TEE executor path, with per-execution logging and timeout enforcement.

#### Automation & Triggers
- Support creation and management of automation jobs (time-based, cron-like, event-driven) under `/automation/jobs` and maintain job run history.
- Register triggers that connect events/webhooks to function executions. Validate payload schemas, enable/disable triggers, and ensure cross-service ownership checks.
- Provide schedulers and dispatchers that retry failures, emit metrics, and can be paused for maintenance.

#### Oracle Adapter
- Manage oracle data sources, queue requests, and accept resolver callbacks/webhook updates.
- Support multiple sources per feed with configurable aggregation (e.g., threshold/median); requests may specify alternate source IDs and aggregators should median/quorum the results.
- Track request lifecycle states (pending, running, succeeded, failed) with persisted attempts, TTL/backoff/DLQ metadata, and idempotent updates. Expired/exhausted requests must dead-letter and surface clearly to operators.
- Provide operator tooling to list failed/expired requests and manually retry them (e.g., via CLI/HTTP PATCH).
- Require runner authentication when marking requests running/complete: callbacks must present a configured runner token via `X-Oracle-Runner-Token` (in addition to API tokens). When no runner tokens are configured, fall back to standard API tokens only.
- Allow per-source authentication headers, outbound host allowlisting, and per-account/source rate limits. Runners/resolvers must authenticate when marking requests running/complete via shared runner tokens.
- Attach schema/versioning to request payloads and constraints on result size; expose latency/success metrics and SLA windows.
- Optional signed result/attestation output with chain/job/spec identifiers for downstream consumers.

#### Price Feed Service
- Create/edit price feed definitions, store historical snapshots, and run periodic refreshers that fetch external data via `PRICEFEED_FETCH_URL` (with optional API keys).
- Emit deviation-based triggers and record submission metadata. Guard against updates when feeds are inactive.
- Support Devpack-driven snapshots via `pricefeed.recordSnapshot` actions (feed ID, price, optional source/collected_at).

#### Gas Bank
- Manage gas accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and settlement polling. Integrate with external withdrawal resolvers defined by `GASBANK_RESOLVER_URL` and optional bearer tokens.
- Expose retry cadence and polling interval tuning via `GASBANK_POLL_INTERVAL` and `GASBANK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (or `runtime.gasbank.poll_interval` / `runtime.gasbank.max_attempts` in config files).
- Support scheduled withdrawals via a future `schedule_at` timestamp; cron expressions are not yet supported and must be rejected.
- Enforce transactional safety (rollbacks on resolver failures), provide transaction history listings, and expose balances via the HTTP API.

#### Randomness Service
- Generate cryptographically secure random bytes per account and optionally sign responses when deterministic replay is required.
- Enforce bounds on the requested length (default 32 bytes, max 1024) and provide multiple encodings in responses.
- Expose `/accounts/{id}/random` for generation requests and `/accounts/{id}/random/requests` for retrieving recent history.

#### Observability & System Services
- Expose `/metrics` for Prometheus scraping and `/healthz` for readiness probes. `/metrics` requires authentication; `/healthz` and `/system/version` remain unauthenticated for orchestrators/discovery.
- Emit structured logs annotated with account/service identifiers. Provide hooks for tracing/metrics per service (see `pkg/metrics`).
- Enforce pagination limits via `limit` parameters to protect the API, returning cursors/tokens where applicable.

#### CRE Orchestrator
- Manage playbooks, runs, and executors for cross-runtime automation.
- Provide CRUD endpoints, execution tracking, and executor registration/heartbeat flows with per-account scoping.

#### CCIP
- Register cross-chain lanes, attach workspace wallets for signing, and manage message dispatch.
- Track status transitions (queued, sending, dispatched, failed) and surface retry metadata to operators.

#### Data Feeds
- Manage the feed registry, signer sets, decimals, and update submission metadata.
- Enforce wallet-gated permissions for submissions and store historic rounds + signatures for auditing. Submissions must validate cryptographic signatures against the configured signer set, enforce minimum signer thresholds, and aggregate multiple submissions per round using a per-feed strategy (median/mean/min/max; defaults to median).
- Apply price/decimals validation, heartbeat/deviation enforcement, and replay protection per signer/round. Expose metrics for stale/under-signed rounds, signer participation, submission latency, and deviations.

#### Data Streams
- Configure high-frequency ingestion, frame publication, SLAs, and retention enforcement parameters.
- Expose frame listings and latency metrics per stream for troubleshooting.

#### DataLink
- Define provider channels, delivery attempts, payload schemas, and retry policies for off-chain data movement.
- Surface per-delivery logs/status plus signer information required for attestations.

#### DTA
- Orchestrate subscription/redemption workflows with approval requirements and wallet checks.
- Track product catalogues, orders, and settlement instructions with immutable audit history.

#### VRF
- Register randomness keys bound to workspace wallets and submit/retrieve randomness requests with attested proofs.
- Store attestation material, consumer metadata, and fulfillment status for each request.

#### Confidential Compute
- Track enclaves, sealed keys, attestation material, and coordinate runner assignments for trusted execution.
- Enforce compliance controls for key upload/rotation and expose enclave health for operators.

### Tooling & Developer Experience
- Maintain parity between CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, and SDK helpers so every capability is scriptable.
- Publish runnable examples (`go test ./...`) for each service to serve as living documentation.
- Provide dashboard modules for operator visibility, backed by the same API routes, surfacing lifecycle status/uptime and errors from `/system/status` (modules + health).
- Ship a docker-compose stack (appserver + Postgres + dashboard) for local bring-up.
  `make docker-compose` or `docker compose up --build` should start the stack with
  sensible defaults (`API_TOKENS`, `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, Postgres DSN); the
  dashboard must point to the running API.

## API & Interface Requirements
### HTTP API
- All routes live under `/accounts/{accountID}/...` (plus `/accounts`, `/metrics`, `/healthz`, `/system`). Payloads are JSON with standard HTTP status codes.
- Enforce bearer-token auth, input validation, and consistent error envelopes (message + code + field errors when applicable).
- List endpoints accept `limit`/`cursor` parameters with enforced bounds and deterministic ordering.
- Long-running operations (automation runs, CRE executions) expose status resources that clients can poll. Webhook callbacks validate shared secrets when configured.

### CLI (`cmd/slctl`)
- Covers every documented service. Current surface:
  - `slctl accounts list|get|create|delete`.
  - `slctl functions list|get|create|delete` plus execution helpers.
  - `slctl automation jobs ...` and `slctl secrets ...` for operator workflows.
  - `slctl gasbank ...` for balances/transactions.
- `slctl oracle sources|requests ...` to manage adapters; `oracle requests list --status <state> --limit <n> [--cursor|--all]` for DLQ triage and `oracle requests retry` to requeue failures.
  - `slctl pricefeeds list|create|get|snapshots`.
  - `slctl cre playbooks|executors|runs --account <id> [--limit n]` for Chainlink Reliability Engine inventory and activity.
  - `slctl ccip lanes|messages --account <id> [--limit n]` for cross-chain lane/message introspection.
  - `slctl vrf keys|requests --account <id> [--limit n]` for randomness key inventory and request history.
  - `slctl datalink channels|deliveries --account <id> [--limit n]` for data movement channel/delivery auditing.
  - `slctl dta products|orders --account <id> [--limit n]` for subscription/redemption inventory review.
  - `slctl datastreams streams|frames --account <id> [--limit n]` for stream configuration/frame inspection.
  - `slctl confcompute enclaves --account <id> [--limit n]` for confidential-compute inventory.
  - `slctl workspace-wallets list --account <id> [--limit n]` for signer/inventory auditing.
  - `slctl random generate` (trigger a draw) and `slctl random list` (recent `/random/requests` history).
  - `slctl services list` for descriptor discovery.
- Reads configuration from flags/environment variables and prints machine-readable tables/JSON for scripting. Extend CLI coverage alongside new HTTP endpoints so every catalogued service eventually ships with parity commands.

### TypeScript Devpack & SDK
- Provide helpers for declaring functions, managing secrets, enqueuing Devpack actions (automation jobs, oracle requests, price feed updates, data feed submissions, data stream frames, DataLink deliveries, randomness, gas bank operations, and trigger registration), and validating inputs locally.
- Price feed updates: `pricefeed.recordSnapshot` helper accepts `feedId`, `price`, optional `source`, and optional `collectedAt` (RFC3339); responses surface snapshot metadata in execution action results.
- Randomness: `random.generate` helper accepts `length` (default 32) and optional `requestId`, returning base64-encoded bytes plus signature/public key metadata in action results.
- Data feeds: `datafeeds.submitUpdate` helper accepts `feedId`, `roundId`, `price`, optional `timestamp` (RFC3339), signer/signature, and metadata; responses return update records.
- Include scaffolding/templates under `examples/functions/devpack` to bootstrap projects.

### Dashboard & External Touchpoints
- The React + Vite dashboard authenticates via the same API tokens and surfaces account/service management flows.
- External integrations: Stripe/Resend for billing/support communications, Logtail/Axiom for log shipping, Neo N3 RPC nodes and other data providers for service execution.

## Data Management & Persistence
- PostgreSQL 14+ is the canonical store. Tables cover accounts, workspace wallets, secrets (encrypted values + metadata), functions (definitions, executions, action history), automation jobs/runs, triggers, oracle sources/requests, price feeds/snapshots, gas accounts/transactions, randomness history, and each service entity described in this catalogue (CRE, CCIP, VRF, Data Feeds, Data Streams, DataLink, DTA, Confidential Compute).
- All database mutations go through versioned migrations under `system/platform/migrations`; the server can auto-apply them when `-migrate`/`database.migrate_on_start` is enabled (defaults to on in the sample config for local/dev). Prefer coordinated rollouts in shared environments by setting `database.migrate_on_start` to false.
- In-memory adapters (under `pkg/storage/memory.go`) provide a dependency-free option for tests and local experimentation.
- Secrets are encrypted before persistence; other sensitive blobs (sealed keys, attestations) follow the same cipher utilities.
- When Postgres is enabled, startup must fail if the configured secret encryption key is missing or invalid to avoid persisting plaintext values.
- No external cache is required; any caching remains in-process. When future Redis integrations are added, they must remain optional and feature-flagged.
- Supabase: the platform targets a self-hosted Supabase Postgres. The `supabase` compose profile bundles GoTrue/PostgREST/Kong/Studio for refresh tokens and admin UI; a smoke helper (`make supabase-smoke`) should verify `/auth/refresh` proxying and `/system/status` before promoting environments. Prefer controlled migrations in CI/CD; keep `database.migrate_on_start` enabled locally and disable it when you orchestrate migrations separately.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Security
- Mandatory TLS termination (handled by the deployment environment) in front of the HTTP API.
- Bearer-token authentication, per-account authorization checks, and validation of cross-service ownership on every request.
- AES-GCM encryption for secrets and sealed materials; zero plaintext storage. Enforce secure key rotation and audit secret access through execution logs.
- Optional TEE executors must verify attestation quotes before accepting workloads.

### Reliability & Observability
- Provide `/healthz` for liveness/readiness, structured logs, and `/metrics` compatible with Prometheus.
- Emit per-service metrics (execution counts, latencies, success/failure) via the observation hooks defined in `pkg/metrics`.
- Export external dependency health (Supabase) as gauges/histograms when `SUPABASE_HEALTH_*` envs are configured so Prometheus/Grafana/alerts can track availability/latency.
- Automation, oracle, CCIP, and delivery pipelines include retry policies with jitter and exponential backoff. Failed jobs must surface in metrics and execution history.

### Performance
- Aim for sub-100ms median latency for metadata/CRUD endpoints and keep function execution scheduling overhead minimal (<10ms beyond runtime execution) under nominal load.
- Price feed refreshers and gas bank settlement pollers must support configurable concurrency and respect external rate limits.

### Scalability
- Support horizontal scaling by running multiple `appserver` instances behind a load balancer; all shared state resides in Postgres.
- Enforce pagination and request limits to protect cluster resources. Each service should guard per-account quotas (feeds, streams, wallets, keys, etc.).

### Maintainability & Developer Experience
- Keep services isolated (`packages/com.r3e.services.<name>`), with interfaces documented in `pkg/storage/interfaces.go` and examples in `*_test.go`.
- Require `go test ./...` to pass before merge, and update this specification whenever surfaces change so it remains the single source of truth.

### Compliance & Auditability
- Record execution/action history and include account IDs, timestamps, and operator identifiers in logs for traceability.
- Preserve attestations, approvals, and wallet mappings required for regulated services (DTA, VRF, Confidential Compute).

## Technical Constraints & Dependencies
- Go 1.24+ for the backend (matching `go.mod`), Node.js 20+ with React 18+/Vite 7+ for the dashboard SPA, and TypeScript 5+ for the Devpack SDK.
- PostgreSQL 14+ with UUID support and advisory locks. The runtime embeds migrations and does not rely on external migration tools at runtime.
- Optional Azure Confidential Computing or equivalent TEE infrastructure for hardware-backed execution. Until production-ready, the software Goja executor remains the default.
- External systems: Neo N3 RPC nodes, price/oracle data providers, Stripe/Resend (billing/support), Logtail/Axiom (log shipping), observability backends compatible with Prometheus/OpenTelemetry.

## Testing, Delivery & Operations
- Unit and integration tests (`go test ./...`) exercise every service, including HTTP handlers and Postgres adapters. Examples in `*_test.go` double as documentation and must remain deterministic.
- CI/CD runs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`), ensuring lint/test/build coverage on every change.
- Local development: `go run ./cmd/appserver -dsn <supabase_dsn>` or `docker compose up --build` (Supabase Postgres). CLI interactions use `go run ./cmd/slctl` or the installed binary.
- Configuration: `DATABASE_URL`, `API_TOKENS`, `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PRICEFEED_FETCH_URL`, `GASBANK_RESOLVER_URL`, `RANDOM_SIGNING_KEY`, and logging level env vars or config files under `configs/` (see `configs/README.md` for the samples).
- Oracle dispatcher tuning: `ORACLE_TTL_SECONDS`, `ORACLE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `ORACLE_BACKOFF`, `ORACLE_DLQ_ENABLED`, and `ORACLE_RUNNER_TOKENS` (or `runtime.oracle.*` in config files) govern expiry, retries, and runner authentication.
- Deployment artifacts are containerized via `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. Rolling updates must respect migrations (run once) and maintain backward compatibility of the HTTP API.
- Helper automation lives under `scripts/` (see `scripts/README.md`) and mirrors the workflows documented in this section.
