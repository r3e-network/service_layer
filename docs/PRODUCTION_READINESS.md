## 3. Architecture Review

### 3.1 Security Architecture ✅

- **TEE Integration**: All services run inside EGo SGX enclaves
- **Secret Management**: Secrets injected via MarbleRun Coordinator
- **mTLS**: Inter-service communication secured with mutual TLS
- **Key Protection**: Private keys never leave enclave memory
- **Attestation**: Remote attestation supported for verification

### 3.2 Service Architecture ✅

| Service | Version | Status | Pattern |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| VRF | 2.0.0 | ✅ Production | Request-Callback |
| Mixer | 3.2.0 | ✅ Production | Off-Chain + Dispute |
| DataFeeds | 3.0.0 | ✅ Production | Push/Auto-Update |
| Automation | 2.0.0 | ✅ Production | Trigger-Based |
| AccountPool | 1.0.0 | ✅ Production | Account Lending |
| Confidential | 1.0.0 | ⚠️ Beta | Sealed Computation |
| Secrets | 1.0.0 | ✅ Production | Encrypted Storage |
| Oracle | 1.0.0 | ✅ Production | HTTP Proxy |

### 3.3 Data Layer ✅

- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with proper connection pooling
- **Persistence**: All critical data persisted to database
- **Recovery**: Services can resume from database state on restart

## 5. Deployment Checklist

### 5.1 Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Configure Supabase database with required tables
- [ ] Deploy Neo N3 smart contracts
- [ ] Configure MarbleRun manifest with secrets
- [ ] Set up TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting

### 5.2 Infrastructure Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 4 cores | 8 cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| Storage | 50 GB SSD | 100 GB SSD |
| SGX | Required | Required |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps |

### 5.3 Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify health endpoints respond
- [ ] Test attestation endpoint
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Test service-to-service communication
- [ ] Run smoke tests in production

---

## 6. Monitoring & Observability

### 6.1 Health Endpoints

All services expose `/health` endpoint returning:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "service-name",
  "version": "x.x.x",
  "enclave": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-08T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### 6.2 Recommended Metrics

- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Request rate per service
- Error rate per service
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory usage per enclave
- Chain event processing lag

---

## 7. Known Limitations

1. **Test Coverage**: Some services have low test coverage (<30%)
2. **Confidential Service**: Still in beta, not recommended for production use
3. **Fairy Tests**: Require external Neo Fairy instance
4. **Chain Integration**: Requires deployed smart contracts

---

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 High Priority

1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Target 60%+ for critical services (mixer, automation, accountpool)
2. **Add Integration Tests**: More tests with mock database
3. **Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling in chain interactions

### 8.2 Medium Priority

1. **Metrics**: Add Prometheus metrics endpoints
2. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to gateway

### 8.3 Low Priority

1. **Documentation**: Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
2. **Performance**: Benchmark and optimize hot paths
3. **Caching**: Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
