# Release Notes - v1.0.0

**Release Date**: December 10, 2025

> Note: the repository architecture has since migrated to a **Supabase Edge**
> gateway and removed legacy services (Go gateway, VRF, NeoVault). This document
> is preserved for historical context; for the current scope see
> `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Overview

We are excited to announce the first stable release of the Neo Service Layer - a production-ready, TEE-protected service infrastructure for the Neo N3 blockchain. This release represents months of development, testing, and security hardening to deliver a robust platform for neocompute computing on Neo.

## What's New

### Core Infrastructure

- **MarbleRun Integration**: Full integration with MarbleRun for TEE orchestration and remote attestation
- **MarbleRun/EGo Support**: All services run in MarbleRun TEE for hardware-level security
- **Gateway**: Thin gateway pattern (today implemented as Supabase Edge Functions) for auth, rate limiting, and routing
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Complete K8s manifests for production deployment with auto-scaling support

### Services

#### 1. Oracle Service
- External data fetching with TEE attestation
- Multi-source price aggregation
- Automatic blockchain submission
- Configurable update intervals and deviation thresholds

#### 2. VRF Service
- Verifiable Random Function for provably fair randomness
- TEE-protected key generation and storage
- Cryptographic proof generation and verification
- Integration with Neo smart contracts

#### 3. NeoVault Service
- Privacy-preserving token mixing
- Multi-hop mixing with configurable delays
- Account pool integration for enhanced privacy
- Support for GAS and NEO tokens

#### 4. Account Pool Service
- Managed pool of funded accounts
- Service-based account locking and allocation
- Automatic balance tracking and updates
- Retirement and replenishment mechanisms

#### 5. NeoFlow Service
- Cron-based job scheduling
- TEE-protected job execution
- Trigger-based neoflow (time, event, condition)
- Comprehensive execution history and monitoring

#### 6. NeoCompute Service
- Data encryption and decryption within TEE
- Digital signature generation
- Key management with attestation
- Resource limits and rate limiting

### Security Features

- **Remote Attestation**: All services provide MarbleRun attestation quotes
- **Manifest Verification**: MarbleRun manifest ensures topology integrity
- **Secrets Management**: Secure injection of secrets via MarbleRun
- **mTLS Communication**: Auto-provisioned certificates for inter-service communication
- **Master Key Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of key generation within TEE

### Developer Experience

- **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Complete REST API reference with examples
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for Docker and Kubernetes deployments
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment
- **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based UI for service monitoring and management
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for service management and testing

### Testing & Quality

- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ code coverage across all services
- **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service integration validation
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with Gosec and Trivy
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking

## Breaking Changes

This is the first stable release, so there are no breaking changes from previous versions. However, please note:

- API endpoints are now versioned (e.g., `/v1/oracle/price`)
- Authentication is required for all non-health-check endpoints
- MarbleRun manifest must be set before services can start

## Installation

### Docker Compose (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R3E-Network/neo-miniapps-platform.git
cd service_layer
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
make docker-up
make marblerun-manifest
```

### Kubernetes (Production)

```bash
# Install MarbleRun
marblerun install --domain service-layer.neo.org

# Deploy services
kubectl apply -f k8s/ --namespace=service-layer

# Set manifest
marblerun manifest set manifests/manifest.json
```

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## API Documentation

Complete API documentation is available at [docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Quick Example

```bash
# Get Oracle price data
curl -X POST https://api.service-layer.neo.org/v1/oracle/price \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "NEO/USD",
    "sources": ["binance", "coinbase"]
  }'
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks

- **Gateway Throughput**: 10,000+ requests/second
- **Oracle Update Latency**: <500ms average
- **VRF Generation**: <100ms per request
- **NeoVault Processing**: <5 seconds per mix operation

### Resource Requirements

- **Minimum**: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 50GB storage
- **Recommended**: 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD
- **Production**: 16+ vCPU, 32GB+ RAM, 200GB+ NVMe SSD

## Security

### Audit Status

- **Code Review**: Internal security review completed
- **Penetration Testing**: Scheduled for Q1 2026
- **Bug Bounty**: Program launching in Q1 2026

### Known Limitations

- MarbleRun TEE memory limited to 256MB (hardware constraint)
- Maximum 1000 concurrent connections per service instance
- Rate limiting enforced at 100 requests/minute per API key

### Reporting Security Issues

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@r3e-network.org. Do not open public GitHub issues for security concerns.

## Monitoring

### Metrics

All services expose Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`:

- Request count and latency
- Error rates
- MarbleRun attestation status
- Resource utilization

### Logging

Structured JSON logs with the following levels:

- `ERROR`: Critical errors requiring immediate attention
- `WARN`: Warning conditions
- `INFO`: Informational messages
- `DEBUG`: Detailed debugging information

## Upgrade Path

This is the first stable release. Future upgrades will follow semantic versioning:

- **Major (2.0.0)**: Breaking API changes
- **Minor (1.1.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Deprecation Policy

- Features will be deprecated with at least 6 months notice
- Deprecated features will be removed in the next major version
- Security-critical changes may have shorter deprecation periods

## Known Issues

1. **Frontend Dashboard**: Some charts may not render correctly in Safari (workaround: use Chrome/Firefox)
2. **Kubernetes**: Requires K8s 1.24+ for proper MarbleRun device plugin support
3. **MarbleRun**: Coordinator restart requires manifest re-verification
