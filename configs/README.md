# Configuration Reference

All configuration expectations, required environment variables, and runtime flags
are defined in the [`Neo Service Layer Specification`](../docs/requirements.md).
This directory simply contains samples you can copy when bootstrapping local
environments.

## Files
- `config.yaml` – canonical YAML sample consumed by `cmd/appserver`. Uncomment or
  edit sections before passing `-config configs/config.yaml`.
- `examples/appserver.json` – JSON version used in documentation snippets.
- `prometheus.yml` – example scrape config aligned with the `/metrics` surface.

Always update the specification first when adding/removing configuration fields.

## Runtime Block

The `runtime` section consolidates what used to be scattered environment
variables for the orchestration runtime:

- `tee.mode` — selects between the mock executor (`"mock"`) and the enclave
  executor (`"enclave"`, or leave empty).
- `random.signing_key` — optional ed25519 private key for deterministic random
  responses (base64 or hex encoded).
- `pricefeed.fetch_url` / `pricefeed.fetch_key` — configure the background price
  feed refresher HTTP fetcher.
- `gasbank.resolver_url` / `gasbank.resolver_key` — configure the settlement
  poller HTTP resolver, with `gasbank.poll_interval` and `gasbank.max_attempts`
  controlling retry cadence.
- `cre.http_runner` — enables the HTTP CRE runner integration.

Every field still honours its corresponding environment variable, so you can
mix-and-match config files and env overrides as needed.

## Auth Block

Use the `auth` section to declare static bearer tokens consumed by the HTTP
gateway. Populate `tokens` with one or more strings. Environment variables
(`API_TOKENS` / `API_TOKEN`) and the `-api-tokens` flag continue to override or
supplement the list when necessary. If no tokens are configured, all protected
endpoints return 401; only `/healthz` and `/system/version` remain public for
probes/discovery.

## Security Block

The `security` section holds the AES key used to encrypt secrets at rest. The
`secret_encryption_key` accepts raw, base64, or hex encodings for 16/24/32 byte
keys. When persistence is enabled (PostgreSQL stores), this field or the
`SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable must be set.
