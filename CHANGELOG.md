## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive security documentation for rate limiting, API key rotation, and audit logging
- Detailed security checklist and implementation status
- Complete DevOps infrastructure with Terraform and Helm charts
- Monitoring dashboards for key metrics
- Devpack runtime with declarative action queueing for functions
- Execution history persistence for action outcomes across storage backends
- JavaScript/TypeScript Devpack SDK (`@service-layer/devpack`) for local development

### Changed
- Consolidated documentation under `docs/`, removed retired LaTeX/PDF exports, and clarified doc-first contribution guidance.
- Documented the supported toolchain versions (Go 1.24+, Node.js 20+, React/Vite dashboard stack).
- Corrected dashboard documentation to reflect the React + Vite implementation and updated setup guidance.
- Added README coverage for `configs/` and `scripts/` so configuration samples and automation tooling stay discoverable.
- Retired unused `devops/init-scripts` and updated docker-compose volumes to point at `configs/`.
- Updated the legacy GitHub workflow to use Go 1.24, the `cmd/appserver` target, and consistent Docker image names.
- Modernized `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` with the same Go/toolchain updates and renamed artifacts (`appserver`, `slctl`, and `service-layer` Docker tags).
- Simplified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run on Go 1.24, build `cmd/appserver`, and produce the same Docker image tag.
- Updated the root `Dockerfile` to Go 1.24 and ship the sample config for parity with other build targets.
- Switched `devops/Dockerfile` to Go 1.24 and the `cmd/appserver` binary to keep parity with the runtime build.
- Aligned `scripts/deploy_azure.sh` with the YAML config path used by the container images.
- Updated Makefile docker targets to use the `service-layer` image name.
- Updated the Helm chart metadata (description/keywords) to reflect the current Service Layer scope.
- Helm default values now use the `ghcr.io/r3e-network/service-layer` image repository.
- Enhanced `scripts/security_scan.sh` to install and run `gitleaks` alongside gosec/Nancy.
- `scripts/run_unit_tests.sh` now covers the `cmd/slctl` package so CLI regressions show up in local runs.
- Updated the root `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` to match the `service-layer` naming and credentials used elsewhere.
- Added `appserver` and `slctl` binaries to `.gitignore` so local builds don't pollute the repo.

### Fixed
- JavaScript runtime execution environment for TEE
- Configuration fields for Azure Confidential Computing
- Import path conflicts and type duplication issues

### Removed
- Deprecated `apps/web` prototype and its cached artifacts; `apps/dashboard` now serves as the sole maintained front-end surface.
- Stripped accidental `node_modules` and `dist` directories from the repo; regenerate them locally via `npm install`/`npm run build` when needed.
- Removed the obsolete `scripts/performance/` helpers that referenced non-existent APIs and load-test assets.
