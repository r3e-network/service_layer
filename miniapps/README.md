# MiniApps

- `builtin/`: first-party MiniApps maintained by this repo
- `community/`: templates and examples for external developers
- `_shared/`: shared, build-free helpers (e.g. SDK postMessage bridge)

This folder contains **static, build-free** MiniApp examples intended to be
served from a CDN and loaded by a host app (see `platform/host-app`).
