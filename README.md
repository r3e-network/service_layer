The Service Layer provides a lightweight orchestration runtime for Neo N3. It
wraps account management, function execution, automation, and gas-bank utilities
behind a simple HTTP API. The runtime can run entirely in-memory for local
experimentation, or wire itself to PostgreSQL when a DSN is supplied.

## Requirements

- Go 1.24+ (matching the toolchain declared in `go.mod`)
- Node.js 20+ / npm 10+ for building the dashboard and Devpack examples
- PostgreSQL 14+ when persistence is required (in-memory stores remain the default)

## Current Capabilities

- Account registry with pluggable storage (memory by default, PostgreSQL when
  configured)
- Function catalogue and executor with trigger, automation, oracle, price-feed,
  and gas-bank integrations
- Devpack runtime with declarative action queueing and a TypeScript SDK for
  authoring functions locally
- Secret vault with optional encryption and runtime resolution for function
  execution
- Cryptographically secure random number generation per account
- Modular service manager that wires the domain services together
- HTTP API located in `internal/app/httpapi`, exposing the new surface under
  `/accounts/...`

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R3E-Network/service_layer.git
cd service_layer

# In-memory mode (no external dependencies)
go run ./cmd/appserver

# Interact with a running instance via CLI (defaults to http://localhost:8080)
go run ./cmd/slctl --token <api-token> accounts list
```

To use PostgreSQL, supply a DSN via flag or environment variable. Migrations are
embedded and executed automatically when `-migrate` is left enabled.

```bash
go run ./cmd/appserver \
  -config configs/examples/appserver.json \
  -dsn "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/service_layer?sslmode=disable"
```

(You may also omit `-config` entirely and only pass `-dsn`.)

Examples for Devpack usage live under `examples/functions/devpack`.

Check `examples/functions/devpack` for a TypeScript project that uses the SDK to
ensure gas accounts and submit oracle requests.

## Operator Interfaces

- **CLI (`cmd/slctl`)** — wraps the HTTP API for scripting. Honours `SERVICE_LAYER_ADDR`
  and `SERVICE_LAYER_TOKEN` like the server. Use it to create accounts, register functions,
  request randomness (`slctl random generate --account <id> --length 64`) or inspect recent draws (`slctl random list --account <id>`), and inspect automation/oracle history from a terminal.
- **Dashboard (`apps/dashboard`)** — React + Vite SPA for day-to-day operations. See
  `apps/dashboard/README.md` for Docker/local instructions. Configure API and Prometheus
  endpoints in the UI once the server is running.

### CLI Quick Reference
- `slctl accounts list|get|create|delete` — manage account records.
- `slctl functions list|get|create|delete` (+ execution helpers) — deploy and inspect functions.
- `slctl automation jobs ...` / `slctl secrets ...` — administer schedulers and secret vault entries.
- `slctl gasbank ...` — view balances and transfer history.
- `slctl oracle sources|requests ...` — configure HTTP adapters and inspect inflight work.
- `slctl pricefeeds list|create|get|snapshots` — define asset pairs and monitor submissions.
- `slctl random generate --account <id> --length <n>` — request deterministic bytes.
- `slctl random list --account <id> [--limit n]` — fetch recent `/random/requests` history.
- `slctl cre playbooks|executors|runs --account <id>` — inspect Chainlink Reliability Engine assets and activity.
- `slctl ccip lanes|messages --account <id>` — list cross-chain lanes and recent CCIP messages.
- `slctl vrf keys|requests --account <id>` — inspect VRF key inventory and recent randomness requests.
- `slctl datalink channels|deliveries --account <id>` — inspect data movement channels and recent delivery attempts.
- `slctl dta products|orders --account <id>` — inspect DTA product catalogues and order history.
- `slctl datastreams streams|frames --account <id>` — inspect high-frequency streams and recent frames.
- `slctl confcompute enclaves --account <id>` — inspect confidential-compute enclave inventory.
- `slctl workspace-wallets list --account <id>` — inspect registered signing wallets.
- `slctl services list` — dump `/system/descriptors` for feature discovery.
- `slctl status` — fetch `/system/status` to inspect server health, version, and services.
- `slctl version` — print CLI build info and query `/system/version` on the server.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # optional, customise DSN / encryption key
docker compose up --build
```

The compose file launches PostgreSQL and the appserver. If `DATABASE_URL` is
left empty (either in the environment or `.env`) the runtime falls back to the
in-memory stores.

## Configuration Notes

- `DATABASE_URL` (env) or `-dsn` (flag) control persistence. When omitted, the
  runtime keeps everything in memory.
- `auth.tokens` (config), `API_TOKENS`/`API_TOKEN` (env), or `-api-tokens` (flag)
  configure bearer tokens for HTTP authentication. All requests must present
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `security.secret_encryption_key` (config) or `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (env)
  provide the AES key for secret storage. A key is required when using
  persistent stores.
- `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` enables AES-GCM encryption for stored secrets (16/24/32
  byte raw, base64, or hex keys are supported). It is required when using
  PostgreSQL.
- `PRICEFEED_FETCH_URL` and `GASBANK_RESOLVER_URL` point
  to the external services responsible for price data and
  withdrawal settlement. Optional `*_KEY` environment variables attach bearer
  tokens when calling those endpoints.
- Oracle data sources are configured per-feed via the HTTP API; no global
  resolver URL is required.
- `RANDOM_SIGNING_KEY` (base64 or hex encoded ed25519 private key) enables
  deterministic signatures for the randomness API. When omitted, a fresh key is
  generated on startup and returned with each response.
- The `runtime` block in `configs/config.yaml` mirrors the legacy environment
  variables for TEE mode selection, random signing keys, price feed fetchers,
  gas bank settlement resolvers, and the CRE HTTP runner toggle. Populate this
  section (or set the corresponding env vars) to drive the new builder-based
  application wiring. CLI flags continue to take precedence where applicable.
- `configs/config.yaml` and `configs/examples/appserver.json` provide
  overrideable samples for the refactored runtime (see `configs/README.md` for details).

## Documentation

All project documentation lives under `docs/`. Start with [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
for navigation and context, then update the [`Neo Service Layer Specification`](docs/requirements.md)
whenever behaviour, APIs, or operations change. The retired LaTeX/PDF spec has been
fully removed—keep the Markdown specification as the single source of truth. Run
the [Service Layer Review Checklist](docs/review-checklist.md) before merging to
confirm the documentation, CLI, and dashboard remain in lockstep. Service
descriptors all advertise the same `platform` layer so every capability is
treated with equal priority.

## Development

- Run **all** tests: `go test ./...`
