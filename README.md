A centralized oracle service for the Neo N3 blockchain, providing secure and scalable oracle services using Azure Confidential Computing TEE.

## Features

- **Functions Service**: JavaScript functions execution in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage and usage of user secrets
- **Contract Automation**: Event-based triggers for smart contract functions
- **Gas Bank**: Efficient gas management for service operations
- **Random Number Generation**: Secure random number generation for contracts
- **Price Feed**: Regular on-chain token price updates
- **Oracle Service**: Bringing external data to Neo N3 blockchain
- **GasBank**: Manage gas tokens for users an

## Architecture

The Neo N3 Service Layer is built on Azure Confidential Computing for TEE capabilities and uses a modular architecture:

- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for user interaction
- **Core Services**: Business logic for all features
- **TEE Environment**: Secure execution of user functions and storage of secrets
- **Neo N3 Blockchain Interface**: Communication with Neo N3 blockchain
- **Web Dashboard**: Comprehensive user interface for service management

## Current Development Status

The project is nearly complete with all core functionality implemented. We have successfully completed:

- Core services implementation (Functions, Secrets, Automation, Oracle, Price Feed, Random Number, Gas Bank)
- TEE integration with Azure Confidential Computing
- Transaction Management System for reliable blockchain interaction
- Web Dashboard with comprehensive user interfaces for all services
- API integration for all service components
- Neo N3 blockchain interface and smart contract integration

For a detailed view of the implementation status and next steps, see:
- [Implementation Status](docs/implementation_status.md) - Current progress
- [Implementation Summary](docs/implementation_summary.md) - Summary of completed work
- [Implementation Plan](docs/implementation_plan.md) - Original plan and progress

## Compatibility Strategy

The service layer depends on several external dependencies, including the Neo-Go SDK, which may undergo API changes between versions. To handle this, we've implemented a compatibility layer approach:

1. **Isolation of External Dependencies**: All direct interactions with external SDKs are wrapped in our compatibility layers in `internal/[package]/compat/` directories.
2. **Versioning**: The `go.mod` file explicitly defines the versions of dependencies we support.
3. **Adaptation**: When upgrading dependencies, we update the compatibility layer rather than changing our core business logic.

For more details, see [our compatibility documentation](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Recent Updates

- Fixed JavaScript runtime execution environment for TEE
- Added configuration fields for Azure Confidential Computing
- Created a compatibility layer for Neo-Go SDK
- Fixed import path conflicts and type duplication issues
- Added comprehensive documentation for components and their implementation status

For a detailed list of issues and their solutions, see [SERVICE_LAYER_ISSUES.md](docs/SERVICE_LAYER_ISSUES.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14 or higher
- Redis 6 or higher
- Azure account with Confidential Computing capabilities
- Node.js 18+ and npm for web dashboard

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/R3E-Network/service_layer.git
   cd service_layer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod download
   cd web && npm install && cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```
   make migrate-up
   ```

6. Start the server and web dashboard:
   ```
   make run-all
   ```

To run the refactored application server directly with PostgreSQL:

```
go run ./cmd/appserver -config configs/examples/appserver.json -migrate
```

YAML configs are supported as well:

```
go run ./cmd/appserver -config configs/config.yaml -migrate
```

You can also supply a DSN without a config file:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/service_layer?sslmode=disable \
go run ./cmd/appserver -addr :8080
```
